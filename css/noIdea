These are not memoirs about myself. 
These are memoirs about other people.' 
The first words of Testimony: the 
Memoirs of Shostakovich' look innocuous 
enough; but they herald a text so cynical, 
so devastating to any received ideas about 
Shostakovich's enigmatic personality and 
his reactions to the events around him 
that it was bound to arouse the strongest 
controversy, particularly among Soviet 
commentators. Maxim Shostakovich, the 
composer's son, has said, according to a 
Reuter report,2 that the book is 'largely a 
compilation of rumours and anecdotes 
collected at third hand' and that the 
editor, Solomon Volkov, 'met [Shostako- 
vich] only four times and for no more 
than two hours each time'. The pro- 
minent weekly Literaturnaya gazeta3 
devoted five full-length columns to a bit- 
ter denunciation, headed 'Zhalkaya pod- 
delka' (Pitiful forgery): the paper's com- 
ment is divided into three sections, com- 
prising, first, a letter to the editor from 
six composers who were close to Shosta- 
kovich (Basner, Vaynberg, Karayev, 
Levitin, Tishchenko and Karen Khacha- 
turian), secondly a lengthy editorial, and 
thirdly an account of the communications 
between the American publisher Harper 
& Row and VAAP, the Soviet copyright 
agency
